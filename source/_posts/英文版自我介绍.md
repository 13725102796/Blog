# 最近的项目 people X
  Recently, In my led projects is people-x.
  People-x is P & G's enterprise wechat multi tenant  platform.
  The old version is based on PHP + angular1 Developed by X.

  Why should we refactor it.
  
  The response of the old system is too slow, the experience is very poor, and the request link is too long, resulting in easy disconnection. The most important thing is that one set of code for one tenant is inconvenient for future maintenance.
  The new system architecture scheme is as follows

● front end: enterprise wechat is based on Vue + vant . The background management system is based on react + ant-design-pro

● back end: Based on spring boot
